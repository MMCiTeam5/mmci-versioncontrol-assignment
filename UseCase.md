## Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?
The use of GitHub for a recipe repository or cook book is a great everyday use of the tool. There will be some limitations though that the user should be aware of before starting. First is patience with getting comfortable to using it. GetHub for sure was made for the IT programming crowd in mind. The non-IT, everyday kind of user will have a slower time getting started with this. Not only is the verbage used not in layman's terms, but the system is not very intuititve. Given the use case of creating a recipe stash or even family cookbook, this may be a significant issue if family members will be adding to the collection of family favorites. 
Another restrictive issue is its functionality with uploading pictures. Many blogs and cook books rely heavily on being able to show a step by step process in a recipe, including the tools that will be needed, to the ingredients, and final product. Many even use videos as well. While GitHub may have live links available, the more clicking around and away from the recipe I have to do, the less I want to use it.
Finally GitHub doesn't allow for the user who likes to "whiteboard" or "spitball' ideas, inhibiting being able to capture the creative process of just throwing out ideas. In this use case of creating a place to store recipes and edit as you make them more, there is less of an issue. But if you were using this as the begining platform to bring ideas together for lets say a dinner party, it may be more work than its worth to use.
