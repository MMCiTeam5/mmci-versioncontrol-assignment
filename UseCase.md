## What would you do differently?
GitHub is a powerful tool developed to help with a range of tasks. In our Use Case, the user did not utilize the full functionality of the tool. For example, he did not create tasks or track the progress of the project. He did not need this for tracking his recipes as he is the only user currently. For the same reason, he does not have active tasks or projects. Perhaps, as his recipes gain more public attention there will be a need for delegation of particular tasks. You can imagine that these functions might be useful if he expands his usage from a simple recipe collection to ensuring that specific chefs edit and modify designated recipes.  The user also did not have a need for code hosting. Finally, he did not automate any of the workflow.

GitHub still serves this user's purpose of publically sharing his documents and maintaining tight version control over them. It remains to be seen whether the user needs robust version control as he currently has no collaborators. Certainly, he will still be able to track his own modifications to his recipes as he matures into a culinary genius. However, he should consider inviting other chefs to his repository and assigning specific tasks.  This will enable them to more rapidly improve their recipes in a collaborative environment while maintaining tight version control through GitHub.
