## Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?
The use of GitHub for a recipe repository or cookbook is a viable use of this version control tool, especially to capture the creative process and have multiple contributers while coming up with the best version of your favorite dish. There will be some challenges in leveraging it that the user should be aware of before starting. First is patience with getting comfortable to using it. GitHub for sure was made for the IT programming crowd in mind. The non-IT, everyday kind of user will have a slower time getting started with this. Not only are the key concepts, commands and workflows not in layman's terms, but the system is not very intuititve. A tutorial on how to use GitHub would be very valuable,but are nearly nonexistent. Given the use case of creating a recipe stash or even family cookbook, this may be a significant issue in this use case with those contributing, ie family members, who may not be very tech savy. The learning curve inclrease with repeated use, now you just have to sell the non-tech person to use it.
Another restrictive issue is its limitation with the size of files that can be uploaded. For text this may not be an issue, but with regards to uploading pictures this could have significat limitations.  Many blogs and cookbooks rely heavily on being able to show a step by step process in a recipe, from the tools that will be needed, to the ingredients, and final product. Many use videos as well, which use a large amount file storage. While GitHub may have live links available, the final product for this use case may be less than desirable due to this limitation. A scondary issue with uploading and using images, video and music is how to version control these files. GitHub's version control for text works extremely well, but is less than desirable for these other formats.
Lastly, if you are reliant on the spell check and grammer corrector functionality, this may be a deal breaker for you. There are ways to "hook" in this feature, but it is not automatic.
