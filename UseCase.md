# MMCi Github Assignment

## Description of Use Case
The use case we've chosen is about using Github and version control for recipes. Specifically, we looked at how this Github user, https://github.com/mathias/recipes, used Github for writing down and storing vegan recipes. His page has a list of his recipes in an easy-to-read markdown format. When he makes one of the dishes, he often goes back and adds notes to the recipe to keep track of anything he might want to change for next time or notes for how it turned out for the readers to know. Using Github allows him to keep a version history of the recipes and see his changes and additions over time. His readme.md file encourages users to fork from his repository, add their own recipes, and edit his readme.md file to let future readers know. This allows users to make changes and additions, without affecting his original recipe.
