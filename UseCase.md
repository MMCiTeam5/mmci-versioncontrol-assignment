## Why is it a good use of version control?
Github for version control of recipes is an excellent case to demonstrate the usability and value of free and open source version control.  Recipes have a history, they may begin with an old family recipe that changes throughout the years.  Github allows for a complete long term change history of every file so each snapshot of the tweaking of the old family recipe will be kept for generation.  Yet great grandchildren will be able to you to revert back to the original recipe or their favorite version of ole family recipe they remember growing up.  They can also compare changes of the recipes over the years and see if someone had introduced an ingredient that made the recipe no longer delicious or took away the butter because they were lactose intolerant.  Most importantly, the recipes will never be lost and easily recoverable. Another great argument for this use case is that recipes on Github are always accessible.  If you are looking for Grandmaâ€™s recipe for chocolate chip cookies to bake in your remote mountain cabin getaway, you can still access the recipe version you want without the internet.   Every time you commit a snapshot of the recipes are stored in your local database making your ability to use or modify them always at your fingertips.
